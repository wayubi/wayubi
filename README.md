> Builder of systems · Engineer of record · Quietly reliable

This repository represents my public GitHub profile — a distilled view of how I think, build, and lead.

I’m a **software engineering consultant with 20+ years of experience**, spanning consumer-facing products, large-scale enterprise systems, financial platforms, and internal tooling. My work lives at the intersection of **architecture, execution, and accountability** — especially in environments where systems are complex, under-documented, or already in motion.

I don’t optimize for noise. I optimize for **coherence, durability, and results**.

## 🧭 What I Value

* **Systems thinking** — architecture, incentives, data flow, failure modes
* **Correctness over flash** — software should behave predictably under pressure
* **Ownership** — if I take it on, it gets finished
* **Automation** — eliminate repetitive work, reduce human error
* **Long-term leverage** — solutions that compound instead of decay
* **Trust** — keeping one’s word matters

## 🛠️ What I Do

### Software Engineering

* Backend-heavy development across PHP, Python, Node.js, C#/.NET
* API-driven systems and service integrations (REST, SOAP, XML, JSON)
* Enterprise web applications and internal business tooling
* Performance optimization, reliability, and observability
* Security-aware development (Veracode Security Labs Champion I–III)

### Automation & Infrastructure

* PowerShell, Bash, and scripting to eliminate manual workflows
* Data migration and normalization pipelines
* Cloud-native deployments (AWS, Azure App Services)
* CI/CD, DevOps practices, and environment parity

### Financial & Trading Systems

* Quantitative trading bots with explicit entry/exit logic
* Indicator-driven decision engines (RSI, ATR, PSAR, trailing exits)
* Position-based accounting (price-in / price-out / realized P&L)
* Minute-level execution with discipline over prediction

### Applied AI (Pragmatic)

* Task-focused assistants
* Workflow augmentation for accounting, research, and education
* Self-hosted and on-prem experimentation over black-box dependency

## 🧠 How I Work

I’m often brought into environments that are:

* minimally defined
* under time pressure
* carrying technical debt
* mid-transition (mergers, rewrites, migrations)

My role is to **make sense of the mess**, identify leverage points, and execute a plan that others can build on.

Patterns I default to:

* explicit state over implicit magic
* boring solutions over clever hacks
* deterministic behavior over surprises
* documentation and logs as first-class features

## 🧱 Experience Highlights

* **Financial Services / Banking** — Loan origination & servicing platforms, post-acquisition system integration, performance optimization, and operational tooling
* **E‑commerce & Marketplaces** — Magento, custom PHP frameworks, Solr/SolrCloud, ElasticSearch, large-scale catalog and search systems
* **Enterprise & SaaS** — API layers, backend portals, internal tools, and data-driven UIs
* **Leadership** — Lead Engineer, Engineering Manager, consultant, and mentor across teams of varying sizes and disciplines

I’ve led teams, coached engineers, stabilized failing projects, modernized legacy systems, and delivered under compressed timelines.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

* Trading and financial tooling
* Backend utilities and automation scripts
* Infrastructure and integration experiments
* Long-lived projects that evolve instead of being rewritten

Some repositories are intentionally minimal. Others are opinionated. All reflect real constraints and real use.

## 🌍 Background

* **Languages:** English (native), Pashto (native), German (limited), Spanish (elementary)
* **Education:** B.A. in History — California State University, Long Beach
* **Certifications:** Zend PHP 5.3, Veracode Security Labs Champion (Levels I–III)

My background in history informs how I approach systems: context matters, decisions compound, and shortcuts have consequences.

## 👤 About Me

Colleagues consistently describe me as:

* reliable
* analytical
* principled
* calm under pressure
* capable of handling ambiguous, high-stakes work

I tend to operate quietly, but I take responsibility seriously — for code, for systems, and for people.
